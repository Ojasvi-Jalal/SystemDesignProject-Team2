# with DisablePir():
#	robot.move()
#	wait_to_return_to_origin()
#
# Outside of the wait block the PIR will start working again
# This will work even if an exception occurs in the wait statement 
# When inside the wait statement the PIR state machine will enter a PIR_BLOCKED state
# It will resume to NOTHING_DETECTED once the wait is over
